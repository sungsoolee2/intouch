# Project 2 InTouch
Created for project 2 at Northwestern Bootcamp Intouch is a real-time, interactive app that helps parents keep "InTouch" with their children and their location.  A google maps view of the child's location is stored and visualized through a custom-made API using Google maps platform, Sequelize, and MySQL database. The family can utilize the built-in real-time chat interface using the socketIO library allowing for full-duplex chat connection between family members. The app's user authentication is handled through OKTA, a cloud-based access management system.
