# Project 2 InTouch
Created for project 2 at Northwestern Bootcamp Intouch is a real-time, interactive app that helps parents keep "InTouch" of their children and they're location.  A google maps view of all the childrens location is stored and visualized through a custom made API using Google maps platform, Sequelize, and MySQL database. When a child leaves a set user defined zone inTouch sends a nodemailer alert to the parents email. The family can utilize the built in real-time chat interface using the socketio library allowing for full-duplex chat connection between family members.The app's user authentication is handled through OKTA a cloud based access management system.
